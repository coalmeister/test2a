1. Shared Libraries: Both "protein_structure_reader.py" and "ligand_reader.py" will require libraries for reading PDB and SDF files respectively. "parameter_developer.py", "topology_builder.py", and "energy_evaluator.py" will require AMBER, GAFF, and openmm libraries respectively.

2. Shared Data: The protein structure and ligand data read by "protein_structure_reader.py" and "ligand_reader.py" will be used by "parameter_developer.py", "topology_builder.py", "object_combiner.py", and "energy_evaluator.py". 

3. Shared Variables: The parameters and topology developed by "parameter_developer.py" and "topology_builder.py" will be used by "object_combiner.py" and "energy_evaluator.py". The combined protein object from "object_combiner.py" will be used by "energy_evaluator.py".

4. Shared Functions: Functions for reading files, developing parameters and topology, combining objects, and evaluating energy will be used across multiple files.

5. Shared Data Schemas: The data schemas for protein structure, ligand, parameters, topology, and combined protein object will be shared across multiple files.

6. Shared Message Names: Messages related to the status of file reading, parameter development, topology building, object combining, and energy evaluation will be shared across multiple files.
